# AI-Media-Analyzer
A suite of AI-powered tools to enhance media accessibility. It includes automated features like image captioning, document summarization, audio and video transcription, and summarization.


#  Objective  #
 Our goal was to create a project that enhances the media consumption experience for everyone, including individuals with impairments. 
 By providing automated solutions like image descriptions and video transcripts,we aimed to make media more accessible and easier to engage with. 
 Whether for general convenience or accessibility needs,this project seeks to bridge gaps and improve how people interact with digital content.

#  Keep in mind  #
 There should be a dataset in the notebook created in order to test the AI called "DATASETS"
 The said dataset is linked and called in all code cells, but the last one. 


##### ---------------------------------- ##### 
  #   In each of the cells we have  #
##### ---------------------------------- ##### 
    Text summarizer, image caption, audio transcript  
          Video transcript and summarizer        
             A media analyzer Web cell        
## >> Which does all of the above with files that can be uploaded ##

#   Key features:    #
 >Document Summarization: Automatically extracts text from PDFs and generates summaries using transformers, improving efficiency for large text processing.
 >Image Captioning: Uses BLIP for generating accurate descriptions of images, beneficial for content tagging and accessibility.
 >Video Transcription: Extracts audio from videos and uses Whisper for transcription, enabling quick access to video content.
 >Video Summarization: Breaks down videos into key frames, generates captions, and creates an overall summary, efficiently capturing video content.

 The system adapts to various content types, making it useful in fields like research, media, and education. 
 It integrates generative AI to streamline tasks and improve productivity.
